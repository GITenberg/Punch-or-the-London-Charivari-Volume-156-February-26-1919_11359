    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>"GERMANY," says Count RANTZAU, "cannot be treated as a
    second-rate nation." Not while it is represented by tenth-rate
    noblemen.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>People are now asking who the General is who has threatened
    not to write a book about the War?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>On Sunday week, at Tallaght, Co. Dublin, seven men attacked
    a policeman. The campaign for a brighter Sunday is evidently
    not wanted in Ireland.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The United States Government is sending a Commission to
    investigate industrial conditions in the British Isles. Mr.
    LLOYD GEORGE, we understand, has courteously offered to try to
    keep one or two industries going until the Commission
    arrives.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Everything that happened more than a fortnight ago," says
    Mr. GEORGE BERNARD SHAW in <i>The Daily News</i>, "always is
    forgotten in this land of political trifling." We must draw
    what comfort we can from the reflection that Mr. SHAW himself
    happened more than a fortnight ago.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Margarine," says an official notice, "can be bought
    anywhere after to-day." This is not the experience of the man
    who entered an ironmonger's shop and asked for a couple of feet
    of it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A woman who threatened to murder a neighbour was fined one
    shilling at Chertsey. We shudder to think what it would have
    cost her if she had actually carried out her threat.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A contemporary refers to "those abominable face-masks" now
    being worn in London. Can this be a revival of the late Mr.
    RICHARDSON'S campaign against the wearing of whiskers?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"A Court of Justice is not a place of amusement," said Mr.
    Justice ROCHE at Manchester Assizes. Mr. Justice DARLING'S
    rejoinder is eagerly awaited.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are informed by "Hints for the Home," that "Salsify may
    be lifted during the next few days." So may Susan, if you don't
    watch out.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>So many safes have been stolen from business premises in
    London that one enterprising man has hit upon the novel idea of
    putting a notice on his safe, "Not to be Taken Away."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A sapper of the Royal Engineers who climbed the steeple of a
    parish church and reached the clock told the local magistrates
    that he wanted to see the dial. That, of course, is no real
    excuse in these days of cheap wrist-watches.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>By order of the Local Government Board influenza has been
    made a notifiable disease. We sincerely hope that this will be
    a lesson to it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An evening paper suggests that the Albert Hall should be
    purchased by the nation. We understand, however, that our
    contemporary has been forestalled by a gentleman who has
    offered to take it on the condition that a bathroom (h. and c.)
    is added.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A correspondent writes to a paper to ask if it is necessary
    to have a licence to play the cornet in the streets. All that
    is necessary, we understand, is a strong constitution and
    indomitable pluck.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We are asked to deny the foolish allegation that several
    M.P.s only went into Parliament because they couldn't get
    sleeping accommodation elsewhere.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In connection with the rush for trains on the Underground,
    an official is reported to have said that things would be much
    better if everybody undertook not to travel during the busiest
    hours.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An American journal advertises a lighthouse for sale. It is
    said to be just the thing for tall men in search of a seaside
    residence.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The policeman who told the Islington bus-driver to take off
    his influenza mask is going on as well as can be expected.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Pwllheli Town Council is reported to have refused the offer
    of a German gun as a trophy. The Council is apparently piqued
    because it was not asked in the first instance whether it
    wanted a war at all.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>All Metropolitan police swords have been called in. We
    decline to credit the explanation that, in spite of constant
    practice, members of the force, kept cutting their mouths.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>French politicians are advocating the giving of an
    additional vote for each child in the family. In France, it
    will be remembered, the clergy are celibate.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"We are looking for the ideal omnibus," says an official of
    the L.G.O.C. We had no idea that they had lost it. Meanwhile
    their other omnibus continues to cause a good deal of
    excitement as it flashes by.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Buildings occupied by the League of Nations," says <i>The
    Daily Mail</i>, "are to enjoy the benefits of
    extraterritoriality." It sounds a lot, but we were afraid it
    was going to be something much more expensive than that.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"In a month," says a news item, "fourteen abandoned babies
    have been found in London." Debauched, no doubt, by the
    movies.</p>

    <h2>GOOD-BYE TO THE AUXILIARY PATROL.</h2>

    <h3>I.&mdash;THE SHIP.</h3>

    <p>When it was announced that we were to be paid off and that
    the gulls and porpoises that help to make the Dogger Bank the
    really jolly place it is would know us no more, there was, I
    admit, a certain amount of subdued jubilation on board. It is
    true that the Mate and the Second Engineer fox-trotted twice
    round the deck and into the galley, where they upset a ship's
    tin of gravy; and the story that the Trimmer, his complexion
    liberally enriched with oil and coaldust, embraced the
    Lieutenant and excitedly hailed the Skipper by his privy
    pseudonym of "Plum-face," cannot be lightly discredited; but at
    the same time I think each one of us felt a certain twinge of
    regret. Life in the future apart from our trawler seemed
    impossible, almost absurd. Pacificists must have known a
    similar feeling on Armistice day.</p>

    <p>Although to the outsider one trawler may look very like
    another, to us who know them personally they differ in
    character and have their little idiosyncrasies no less than
    other people. Some are quite surly and obstinate, others
    good-humoured and light-hearted; where one exhibits all the
    stately dignity of a College head-porter another may be as
    skittish and full of fun as a magistrate on the Bench. There
    was one trawler at our base so vain that they could never get
    her to enter the lockpits until her decks had been scrubbed and
    a string of bunting hoisted at the foremast. It is
    surprising.</p>

    <p>Taking her all in all our trawler was a good sort, one of
    the best. When steaming head to wind in a heavy sea she
    certainly shipped an amazing quantity of water, and even in a
    comparative calm she would occasionally fling an odd bucketful
    or so of North Sea down the neck or into the sea-boots of the
    unwary; but it was only her sense of fun. She took particular
    delight in playing it on a new member of the crew; it made him
    feel at home.</p>

    <p>She was not what you would call a really clean ship&mdash;as
    the Skipper said, if you washed your hands one day they were
    just as bad again the next&mdash;but anyone who makes a fuss
    over a trifle like that is no true-born sailorman. We all loved
    her and were proud of her speed, for she could make nine knots
    at a push. Even the Second Engineer, who had been a fireman in
    the Wilson line, was moved to admit in a moment of admiration
    that she didn't do so badly for a floating pig-trough, which
    was no meagre praise from a man with such a past.</p>

    <p>She was a touchy ship, quick to resent and avenge a slight
    on her good name. We had a strange Lieutenant one trip who came
    from a depot ship at Southampton and wore a monocle. He was
    rather sore at having to exchange a responsible harbour billet
    for the command of a mere sea-going trawler, and expressed the
    opinion that there might be more disgustingly dirty ships
    afloat than ours, but if so they were not allowed out during
    official daylight; We felt her quiver from stem to stern with
    rage. She took her revenge that evening as the Lieutenant was
    coming aft for tea. It was a floppy sea and he unwisely
    ventured along the windward side of the casing, and she seized
    her opportunity. The Mate picked him up out of the scuppers and
    we dried his clothes over the boilers, but the monocle was
    never seen again. The crew were not so sympathetic as they
    might have been; they felt that he had asked for it.</p>

    <p>But, though her personal beauty would not have been
    unrivalled at a Cowes Regatta and her somewhat erratic motions
    were not calculated to bring balm to the soul of an unseasoned
    mariner, she was a faithful ship, and no one could ever
    question her courage. At the sight of a hostile periscope she
    used positively to see red, and she once steamed across a
    mine-field without turning a hatch-cover. Throughout her naval
    career she was a credit to the White Ensign and bravely upheld
    the proud traditions of her ancestors.</p>

    <p>She is to be handed back to her owners and will presumably
    return to the more peaceful occupation of deep-sea fishing. It
    will be strange to think of her still labouring away out there
    on the Nor'-East Rough whilst we who have shared her trials so
    long are following once more the less arduous ways of the land.
    If she prove as eager in the pursuit of her undersea quarry as
    she was on the trail of the U-Boat I would not change places
    with the cod and haddocks of the North Sea for the prize-money
    of an Admiral. Good luck to her!</p>

    soft patch on the far side of Tournai. William afflicted their
    gun teams with his little Hotchkiss gadget, then prepared to
    gallop them. He had unshipped his knife and was offering his
    sergeant long odds on scoring first "pink," when our two
    squadron trumpeters trotted out from a near-by coppice and
    solemnly puffed "Cease Fire"&mdash;for all the world as if it
    was the end of a field-day on the Plain and time to trot home
    to tea. William was furious.</p>

    <p>"There y'are," he snorted. "Just because I happened to have
    a full troop out for once, all my horses fit, no wire or
    trenches in the way, the burst of the season ahead and the only
    chance I've had in four and a-half years of doing a really
    artistic bit of carving they must go and stop the ruddy War.
    Poo! ain't that the bally Army all over? Bah! I've done with
    it."</p>

    <p>So he filled in the bare patches in every Demobilisation
    Form Z 15 he could lay pen to.</p>

    <p>Taking the proud motto of the MOND dynasty&mdash;"Make
    yourself necessary"&mdash;for guide, he became something
    different every day in his quest after an "Essential Trade." He
    was in turn a one-man-business, a railway-porter, a coal-miner,
    a farmer, a NORTHCLIFFE leader-writer, a taxi-baron, a
    jazz-professor and a non-union barber. At one moment he was
    single, an orphan alone and unloved; at another he had a
    drunken wife, ten consumptive young children and several
    paralytic old parents to support. All to no avail; nobody would
    believe him.</p>

    <p>Then one day he heard from a friend who by the simple
    expedient of posing as a schoolmaster for a few minutes was now
    in "civvies" and getting three days' hunting and four days'
    golf a week.</p>

    <p>William grabbed up yet another A.F. Z 15, and dedicated his
    life to the intellectual uplift of the young.</p>

    <p>This time he drew a reply and by return.</p>

    <p>Corps H.Q. held the view that he, William, was the very
    fellow they had been looking for, longing for, praying for.
    They had him appointed Regimental Educational Officer (without
    increase of rank, pay or allowances) on the spot, and would he
    get on with it, please, and indent through them for any
    materials required in the furtherance of the good work?</p>

    <p>William was furious. Confound the Staff! What did the
    blighted red-tape-worms take him for? A blithering pedagogue in
    cap, gown and horn spectacles? He kicked the only sound chair
    in the Mess to splinters, cursed for two hours and sulked for
    twenty-four. After which childish display he pulled himself
    together and indented on Corps Educational Branch for four
    hundred treatises on elementary Arabic, Arabic being the sole
    respectable subject in which he was even remotely competent to
    instruct.</p>

    <p>Corps H.Q. tore up his indent. It was absurd, they said, to
    suppose that the entire regiment intended emigrating to Arabia
    on demobilisation. William must get in touch with the men and
    find out what practical everyday trades they were anxious to
    take up.</p>

    <p>William was furious. "Isn't that the rotten Staff all over?"
    he fumed. "Make an earnest and conscientious effort to give the
    poor soldiers a leg-up with a vital, throbbing, commercial and
    classical <i>patois</i> and the brass-bound perishers choke you
    off! Poo-bah! Na poo!"</p>

    <p>Then he pulled himself together again and indented on Corps
    Educational Branch once more, this time for "Lions; menagerie;
    one." Corps came down on William like St. Paul's Cathedral
    falling down Ludgate Hill. What the thunder did he mean by it?
    Trying to be funny with them, was he? He must explain himself
    instantly&mdash;Grrrr!</p>

    <p>William was very calm. Couldn't understand what all this
    unseemly, uproar was about, he wrote. Everything was in order.
    Obeying their esteemed instructions to the letter he had made
    inquiries among the men as to what practical everyday trades
    they were wishful to learn, and, finding one stout fellow who
    was very anxious to enter public life as a lion-tamer, he had
    indented for a lion for the chap to practise on. What could be
    more natural? Furthermore, while on the subject, when they
    forwarded the lion, would they be so good as to include a
    muzzle in the parcel, as he thought it would be as well to have
    some check on the creature during the preliminary lessons.</p>

    <p>Corps H.Q.'s reply to this was brief and witty. They
    instructed the Adjutant to cast William under arrest.</p>

    <p>William was furious. PATLANDER.</p>

    <h2>PRINCESS CHARMING.</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a Royal christening.</p>

    <p>It was a very grand christening and the highest in the land
    were among the assembled guests. There was more than one Royal
    Personage present, and many lords and ladies and ambassadors
    and plenipotentiaries and all manner of dignified and imposing
    people.</p>

    <p>For it was a real Princess that was being christened, which
    is a thing that does not occur every day in the year.</p>

    <p>Quite a number of fairies were there too. Fairies are very
    fond of christenings, and there are always a good many of them
    about on these occasions.</p>

    <p>They were very lavish in their gifts.</p>

    <p>One gave the baby beauty; another gave her a sweet and
    gentle disposition; another, charm of manner; a fourth, a quick
    and intelligent mind. She really was a very fortunate baby, so
    many and so varied were the gifts bestowed upon her by the
    fairy folk.</p>

    <p>Last of all came the Fairy Queen.</p>

    <p>She arrived late, having come on from a coster's wedding in
    the East End of London, a good many miles away.</p>

    <p>She was rather breathless and her crown was a little on one
    side, indeed her whole appearance was a trifle dishevelled.</p>

    <p>"Oh, my dear," she murmured to her chief lady-in-waiting as
    she bustled lightly up the aisle, "I've had such a time. It was
    a charming wedding. The tinned-salmon was delicious, and there
    were winkles&mdash;and gin. I only just tasted the gin, of
    course, for luck, you know, but really it was very good. I had
    no idea&mdash;And there was a real barrel-organ, and we danced
    in the street. The bride had the most lovely ostrich feathers.
    The bridegroom was a perfect dear. I kissed him: I kissed
    everyone, I think. We all did ... Now what about this baby?"
    For by this time they had reached that part of the church where
    the ceremony was taking place. "I suppose you've already given
    her most of the nice things?"</p>

    <p>The lady-in-waiting rapidly enumerated the fairy-gifts which
    the fairies had bestowed upon the child.</p>

    <p>The Queen looked at the baby.</p>

    <p>"What a darling!" she said; "I must give her something very
    nice." She hovered a moment over the child's head, "She shall
    marry the man of her choice," she said, "and live happily ever
    after."</p>

    <p>There was a little stir among the fairies. The
    lady-in-waiting laid her hand on the Queen's arm.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid Your Majesty has
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
       id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span> forgotten," she said; "this
       is a Royal Baby."</p>

    <p>"Well," said the Queen, "what of that?"</p>

    <p>"You know we rather make it a rule not to interfere in these
    matters in the case of Royalty," said the lady-in-waiting. "We
    generally leave it to the family. You see they usually prefer
    to make their own arrangements. There are reasons. We can give
    a great deal, but we can't do <i>everything</i>. Besides, it
    would hardly be fair. They have so many advantages&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The Fairy Queen looked round at all the people who were
    assembled in the church; she had indeed forgotten for the
    moment what a very important occasion this was. Then she looked
    at the baby.</p>

    <p>"I don't care," she said, "I don't care. She's a darling,
    and she <i>shall</i> marry the man of her heart. I'm sure it
    will be someone nice. You'll see, it'll be all right."</p>

    <p>She kissed the baby's forehead, and the little Princess
    opened wide her blue eyes and smiled. Several people; noticed
    it.</p>

    <p>"Did you see the baby smile at the Bishop?" they said to one
    another afterwards. But then, you see, nobody but the baby
    could see the Fairy Queen.</p>

    <p>The other fairies were still a little perturbed. They shook
    their heads doubtfully and whispered to one another as they
    floated out of the church. It wasn't done.</p>

    <p>"If only she had made it a King's son," the chief
    lady-in-waiting muttered to herself. "That would have made it
    so much better. But 'the man of her choice'&mdash;so very
    vague."</p>

    <p>The Fairy Queen, however, was quite happy. She laughed at
    the solemn faces of her retinue.</p>

    <p>"You'll see," she repeated, "it will be quite all right."
    And she flew gaily off to Fairyland.</p>

    <p>This isn't a fairy story at all. That's the nicest part
    about it. It all really happened. And the real name of the
    Princess&mdash;Oh, but I needn't tell you that.
    <i>Everybody</i> knows who Princess Charming is. R.F.</p>

    <h3>THE 1930 FLYING SCANDAL.</h3>

    <p><i>To the Editor of "The Wireless News." 1st June,
    1930</i>.</p>

    <p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I wish to protest through your columns
    against the outrageous behaviour of the drivers of public air
    conveyances on the Brighton Front.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I and other passengers boarded a ramshackle
    aero-&agrave;-banc (the floor of which was covered with musty
    straw) with the intention of having a "joy-trip" to
    Rottingdean. The fare was two shillings and sixpence. We had
    not mounted five hundred feet into the air before the driver
    yelled to us, "Nah then, another 'arf-a-chrahn all rahnd or
    I'll loop the loop." We were forced to comply with the demand
    of this highwayman of the atmospheric thoroughfares; but on
    alighting I took the first opportunity of giving his number to
    a policeman.</p>

    <p>One sighs for the old-fashioned courtesy of the taxi-cab
    driver of another decade.</p>

    <h2>MUSICAL GOSSIP FROM THE GERMAN FRONT.</h2>

    <p>"For the last twenty years," writes M. JEAN-AUBRY, a
    distinguished French musical critic, "the temple of German
    music has been no longer at Bonn, or Weimar, or Munich, or
    Bayreuth, but at Essen. The modern German orchestra, with
    Strauss and Mahler, was concerned more with the preoccupations
    of artillery and the siege-train than with those of real music.
    It desired to become a rival of Krupp."</p>

    <p>These remarks are borne out in a remarkable way by the
    latest news of STRAUSS. It has always been very difficult to
    obtain precise intelligence about his works, owing to his
    notorious aversion from publicity, and we accordingly give this
    information with all reserve, simply for what it is worth. It
    is to the effect that, while retaining the parts for three
    Minenwerfen in his new Battle Symphony, he has been obliged to
    re-score one movement in which four "Big Berthas" were
    prominently engaged, owing to the impossibility of securing any
    of these instruments since the Armistice. He has, however, with
    admirable resource substituted parts for four influenza
    microbes. There are no French horns in the score, but by way of
    showing a conciliatory spirit to the British army of occupation
    he has introduced in the <i>Finale</i> an adaptation of a
    well-known patriotic song, which is marked on the margin,
    "<i>Die W.A.A.C. am Rhein</i>."</p>

    <h2>KISMET.</h2>

    <p>Those old comrades, Sergeant Kippy and Gunner Toady, stood
    on the steps of the Convalescent Home and regarded the peaceful
    country-side which, in South Devon, is a sedative even in
    February.</p>

    <p>Gunner Toady had come over for the day, and Kippy, as an
    inhabitant of the Home, had been exercising his prerogative of
    showing a guest over the estate. During the great advance which
    proved to be the expiring effort of the Hun, the Gunner had
    acquired a shortened leg, which still caused him to revolt
    against sustained physical exertion.</p>

    <p>He leant upon his stick and listened while Kippy the
    indefatigable drew up a programme of a further tour to some
    outlying buildings.</p>

    <p>"And you 'aven't seen the melin-'ouse," concluded that
    worthy, enthusiastically waving his remaining arm in the
    direction of a far shrubbery.</p>

    <p>"Melin-'ouses in Febuary is lugoobrious," said the Gunner;
    "we'll remain at the chatoo."</p>

    <p>Kippy sat down on the top step.</p>

    <p>"Curious," he said, "to think there ain't no war on. Makes
    you feel idle. Remember that day at Coolomeers (Coulommiers),
    when we first got interdooced?" The Gunner nodded. "'Bout a
    thousand years ago that was, an' not 'alf a beano&mdash;'orse,
    foot and guns; no stinks, no blinkin' fireworks and old VON
    KLUCK gettin' 'ome pronto."</p>

    <p>"Yes," his companion said slowly, as he lowered himself to
    sit beside Kippy, "that was September '14. I took my first
    knockout there, an' then clicked with you again in Southmead
    'Ospital at Bristol."</p>

    <p>"An'," Kippy took up the tale, "we come together agen at the
    end o' '15 in the old salient at Wipers, an' in '16 we was
    foregathered on the Somme. That's where I got my first dose of
    Fritz's gas. Put me in Blighty three months, that did; an' I
    won the ten-stone clock-golf putting championship of
    'Ereford."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the Gunner ruminatively, "we've had to handle
    all sorts in this show; wy, I've played a game called Badminton
    with a real princess a-jumpin' about t'other side of the net.
    O' course it ain't discipline."</p>

    <p>"Well," said Kippy, "I got two years' service before the
    War. That makes six an' a bit; and next month I shall 'ave my
    Mark 1919 patent arm complete with all the latest developments
    and get into civvies. Then what-o for a job o'
    paper-'anging."</p>

    <p>Gunner Toady gave a slight start, but at once passed into a
    state of deep reflection. After a protracted pause he delivered
    his mature judgment. "'Course," he said slowly, "I believe in
    wot them Mahomets call Kismet. No gettin' away from
    it&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oo's Kismet?" interrupted Kippy.</p>

    <p>"It's me and you gettin' mixed up so intimate over 'arf o'
    France and the 'ole o' Flanders. Like two needles in a blinkin'
    'aystack clickin' every time&mdash;an' 'taint as if the Gunners
    dossed down reglar with the Line either. An' now you talks
    about paper-'anging."</p>

    <p>Gunner Toady paused impressively and continued, "Now you'd
    'ardly believe it, but before I joined the reg'ment in '09 I
    was a master-plasterer workin' in Fulham."</p>

    <p>"Lumme!" exclaimed Kippy, "wy, I was at Putney then, and I
    only 'eard the other day that there's a nice little
    <i>apray-lar-gur</i> connection to be worked up at Walham
    Green. 'Ow about callin' ourselves 'Messrs. Toady and Kippy,
    Decorators'?'"</p>

    <p>"That's what it means," said the senior partner. "It's
    Kismet right enough, and there ain't no gettin' away from
    it."</p>

    <p>"And we might add," said Kippy, with a touch of

    <h2>COAL-DUST.</h2>

    <p>"Had a good day?" said Frederic cheerily, stamping the snow
    off his boots as I met him at the front-door.</p>

    <p>"That depends," I said, "on what you call a good day."</p>

    <p>"You haven't been dull?" said Frederic.</p>

    <p>"Oh, no," I said, indicating the comforting blaze as I
    pushed Frederic's chair to the fire; "behold the result of my
    day's labours in your behalf. Your hot bath and hot breakfast,
    dear, were just camouflage to keep from you, the centre of
    gravity, our desperate straits. When I went to give Cook her
    orders this morning I found her as black as a sweep and in a
    mood to correspond. She pointed to a few lumps of coal in the
    kitchen scuttle and said, 'I've sifted all that dust in the
    cellar, Ma'am, and these are the only lumps I could find.
    There's only enough to cook one more dinner.'"</p>

    <p>"My dear girl," said Frederic, "why wait till there is no
    coal before ordering more?"</p>

    <p>"Hear me," I cried. "A fortnight ago I ordered some. The man
    asked, 'Have you <i>any</i> coal?' I said I had a little. He
    said, 'You are lucky to have <i>any</i>. Dozens of people have
    no coal at all. I can promise nothing.'</p>

    <p>"A week ago I went again. 'Have you <i>any</i> coal?' he
    asked. 'Still a very little,' I said faintly. 'Hundreds of
    people,' he said, 'have no coal at all, I can promise you
    <i>nothing</i>.'</p>

    <p>"'Well, after I had spent an hour this morning distributing
    whiffy oil-lamps all over the house, I went again to the coal
    merchant. He froze me with a look. 'When can you send in my
    coal?' I tried to say it jauntily, but my teeth chattered.
    'Have you <i>no</i> coal?' he said, and his frigid eye pierced
    me. 'O-o-only a little dust, which, has been at the bottom of
    the cellar for two years&mdash;drawing-room coal dust,' I added
    eagerly, 'which cannot be used on the kitchen fire.' 'You are
    lucky,' he said, 'to have that. There are thousands of people
    in this town with no coal at all. We can promise you
    nothing.'</p>

    <p>"I came home, and after luncheon, donning my Red Cross
    uniform, I told Mary that if people called she could show them
    into the coal-cellar, where I should be; and, armed with a
    garden-fork, I proceeded thither and dug diligently for a whole
    hour. I know now exactly why a hen clucks when she has laid an
    egg. Every time I found a lump&mdash;and I found as many as
    six&mdash;I simply had to call Cook and Mary to come and
    see."</p>

    <p>"What fun!" murmured Frederic comfortably.</p>

    <p>"I venture to suggest, dear, that the thing is beyond a
    joke. When I next go to the coal-monger's I shall say in reply
    to the inevitable question, 'A little coal-dust in the cellar
    and a good deal on the chairs and tables and on my hands and
    face;' and I know he will say: 'You are lucky to have even
    that. There are millions in this town who, etc., etc.' And so
    the thing will go on until one day he asks, 'Have you no fuel
    at all?' when I can hear myself replying, 'Only two chairs and
    one wardrobe,' and he will reply icily, 'You are lucky to have
    that. Everybody else is dead because they had not even
    that.'</p>

    <p>"And Frederic," I added abruptly, "as a coal-miner I demand
    the minimum wage for my day&mdash;your hot bath to-morrow
    morning."</p>

    <h2>DEMOBILISATION.</h2>

    <h3>THE SITUATION MADE CLEAR.</h3>

    <p>"It is quite clear," said the Adjutant, "that Second-Lieut.
    X must stay."</p>

    <p>"Of course," said the G.O.C. Demobs, or, as he is more often
    called, "Mobbles." "He stays because he doesn't go."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the Adjutant's child full, like the elephant's
    child, of insatiable curiosity, "X stays because he is retained
    for selection until he is selected for retention, or, to put it
    more clearly, he belongs to a class which could go if it had
    any reason for going and if it wanted to go and wasn't retained
    as eligible or wasn't eligible for retention. In other words he
    is in one of the two classes&mdash;those who are available to
    go and those who are eligible to stay."</p>

    <p>"Or, conversely," said Mobbles, "those who are available to
    stay and those who are eligible to go."</p>

    <p>"Exactly," said the Adjutant; "but which?"</p>

    <p>"The other," said the Adjutant's child. "Now, if he was only
    in the same boat as Y, the position would be different. Y is
    here because, though eligible for release, he is available for
    retention."</p>

    <p>"The problem appeared quite simple at first," said the
    Adjutant, "but now you've made it all muddy."</p>

    <p>"It is simply this," said Mobbles; "is he eligible for
    retention or merely available for release? If the former, is he
    available for demobilisation, and if the latter, is he eligible
    for retention? No; what I mean is just this&mdash;Is he here or
    is he&mdash;No; I'll start again. Is he retained, and if not
    why not?"</p>

    <p>"Exactly," said the Adjutant's child. "Is he under'
    thirty-seven, and if so why was he born in 1874, or, to put it
    quite clearly&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Shut up," said the Adjutant. "I want to get it clear before
    you confuse me again. We'll start afresh. X is eligible to go
    because he joined the Army before 1916. On the other hand,
    being under thirty-seven, he must stay."</p>

    <p>"That must, I think, be wrong," said Mobbles.</p>

    <p>"Quite," said the Adjutant's child.</p>

    <p>"Well, then, put it in another way," said the Adjutant. "X
    can't be demobilised because there is no reason for his going,
    and he can't stay because there is no authority for retaining
    him. In other words, to put it quite clearly, as he is being
    retained he can't go, and as he is being demobilised he isn't
    to be retained. Do I make myself clear?"</p>

    <p>"Quite," said the Adjutant's child.</p>

    <p>Mobbles was beyond speech and busily engaged in working it
    out on paper in decimals.</p>

    <p>There was, a knock at the door; a signaller brought a wire,
    "Report immediately position of Second-Lieut. X."</p>

    <p>There was a moment's silence as the Adjutant grasped a
    message-pad and thought deeply what to say. He wrote a few
    lines and then looked up. "This is what I have said:
    'Second-Lieut. X staying if retained, but available to go if
    eligible; also eligible for retention if available.' Am I
    clear?"</p>

    <p>"Quite," said the Adjutant's child.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, February 17th</i>.&mdash;On the motion for the
    rejection of the Bill to relieve Ministers from the necessity
    of re-election, Mr. PEMBERTON-BILLING incidentally revealed the
    horrifying fact that he has compiled another Black Book,
    containing a full list of the PRIME MINISTER'S election
    pledges. They do not quite come up to the notorious figure of
    47,000; but they total 1,211, which seems enough to go on with,
    and they are all "cross-referenced."</p>

    <p>More serious, from the Government's point of view, was the
    criticism of some of their regular supporters. Lord WINTERTON,
    speaking as an old Member of the House&mdash;though he still
    looks youthful enough to be its "baby," as he was fifteen years
    ago&mdash;affirmed the value of by-elections as a gauge for
    public opinion; Major GRAEME, one of the new Coalitionists,
    thought it would be a mistake to part with a means of testing
    the record of a Ministry which the War has "swollen to the size
    of a Sanhedrim."</p>

    <p>As the soft answers of the ATTORNEY-GENERAL&mdash;whom the
    late Mr. ROOSEVELT would have probably termed
    "pussy-footed"&mdash;failed to quell the rising storm, the
    LEADER OF THE HOUSE bowed before it and offered to agree to the
    insertion in the Bill of a time-limit.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Something had evidently annoyed Mr. DEVLIN. Whether it was
    the intimation that the new Housing Bill was not to apply to
    Ireland (which has had similar legislation for years past), or
    that in future the out-of-work donation in that country would
    be confined to persons possessing more or less right to it, or
    (most probably) that an interfering Saxon had announced his
    intention of moving a "Call of the House" in order to get the
    recalcitrant Sinn Feiners to take up their Parliamentary
    duties, I do not know. At any rate the Nationalist seized the
    opportunity of delivering a general attack upon the Government
    of such overwhelming irrelevance that Mr. WHITLEY, the least
    sarcastic of men, was driven to remark, "I think the honourable
    Member is under the impression that this is last week."</p>

        <h4>GOVERNMENT PROMISES.</h4>MR. PEMBERTON BILLING
        compiles another Black Book.
    </div>

    <p>I trust that Mr. CHURCHILL, who is conducting the business
    of the War Office in Paris, will not read the Official Report
    of the debate on the Aerial Navigation Bill. For I am sure it
    would be as great a shock to him as it was to me to learn that
    Mr. MOSLEY (<i>&aelig;tat</i> twenty-two) considered him, in
    aviation affairs, as lacking in imagination. The idea of anyone
    regarding our WINSTON as a doddering old fossil!</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 18th</i>.&mdash;As is usual at this
    period of the Session the Lords find themselves with nothing to
    do, and being ineligible for the out-of-work donation they
    naturally grumble. Foreman CURZON endeavoured to pacify them
    with the promise of one or two little jobs in the near future;
    and Lord BUCKMASTER kindly furnished them with something to go
    on with by raising the topic of industrial unrest in a speech
    composed in about equal measure of admirable platitudes and
    highly disputable propositions. Its principal merit was to
    furnish the new LORD CHANCELLOR with an occasion for delivering
    his maiden speech. This he did with proper solemnity, though
    once he slipped into his after-dinner style and addressed his
    august audience as "My Lords and Gentlemen." His nearest
    approach to an epigram was the remark that "the nation had been
    living on its capital and liking it." On the whole he took a
    hopeful view of the situation&mdash;more so than Lord
    LANSDOWNE, who expressed "the profoundest dismay" at our
    increasing indebtedness. Fortunately His Lordship's gloomy
    prophecies have not invariably proved correct.</p>

    </div>

    <p>After Question-time in the Commons Mr. BOTTOMLEY made bitter
    complaint to the SPEAKER that he had been evicted from his
    favourite corner-seat by the Member for South-East St. Pancras.
    Mr. LOWTHER administered chilly consolation. Those little
    <i>contretemps</i> were apt to occur at the beginning of every
    new Parliament; and he was not going to lay down a
    hard-and-fast rule on the subject before it was necessary.</p>

    <p>Old Parliamentarians will remember the long-continued
    struggle between Mr. GIBSON BOWLES and a colleague who was
    always endeavouring to insert "the thick end of the GEDGE" into
    "Tommy's" favourite seat. Mr. HOPKINS is the Member who has
    jumped Mr. BOTTOMLEY'S claim on the present occasion&mdash;a
    fact which will recall THEODORE HOOK'S remark that the game of
    leap-frog always reminded him of those famous psalmodists,
    STERNHOLD and HOPKINS.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 19th</i>.&mdash;According
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"
       id="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span> to Lord STRATHSPEY there
       are thousands of men in the Army longing to take Orders in
       the Church Militant, but there are no funds available for
       training them, and no prospect of a living wage for them if
       ordained. The LORD CHANCELLOR'S sympathetic references to
       the painful plight of men whose duty it was to preach
       content here and hereafter will no doubt be reflected in the
       administration of his not inconsiderable patronage.
       Fortunately or unfortunately the clergy cannot or will not
       "down surplices" to improve their condition.</p>

    <p>The unrest in other sections of the working-classes was
    further examined from various angles. Lord RIBBLESDALE would
    like them to take a greater share in the profits, and also in
    the "responsibilities and vicissitudes" of industry. But this
    suggestion will hardly appeal to them if, as Lord LEVERHULME
    declared, Labour would have made a poor bargain if it had
    swapped its increased wages for all the excess profits made
    during the War. Lord HALDANE'S view, as perhaps you would
    expect, was that neither Capital nor Labour, but the "organised
    mind," was the principal agent in producing wealth. Altogether
    it was an informing debate, which the Government might do worse
    than reproduce in pamphlet form for the instruction of the
    public.</p>

    <p>On the news of the attack on M. CLEMENCEAU reaching the
    Commons there was a general desire that the House should pass a
    resolution of sympathy. But Mr. BONAR LAW deprecated the
    proposal as being, in his opinion, "against all
    precedent"&mdash;not a little to the surprise of some of the
    new Members, who thought that in a case like this the
    <i>conseil du pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent</i> might bow to the
    <i>President du Conseil</i>.</p>

    <p>In the procedure debate a strong demand was made that a full
    official report of the speeches delivered in the six Grand
    Committees should be issued. But the ATTORNEY-GENERAL pointed
    out that everything was already reported "except the talk," and
    found a powerful supporter in Sir EDWARD CARSON, who believed
    that no official reports would have any effect in keeping
    Ministers to their pledges. <i>Hansard</i> is as <i>Hansard</i>
    does, is his motto.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, Feb. 20th</i>.&mdash;Every question put down
    costs the tax-payer, it is calculated, a guinea. This afternoon
    there were no fewer than two hundred and eighty-two of them on
    the Order-Paper. It would be interesting to see what effect
    upon this cascade of curiosity would be produced if every
    Member putting down a question were obliged to contribute, say,
    ten shillings to the cost of answering it; the amount to be
    deducted from his official salary. If such a rule had been
    enforced in the last Parliament Mr. JOSEPH KINO, for one, would
    have had no salary to draw.</p>

    <p>The shortage of whisky and brandy for medicinal purposes was
    the subject of many indignant questions. Mr. MCCURDY, for the
    FOOD-CONTROLLER, stated that it had been found impracticable to
    allot supplies of spirits for this purpose, but, perhaps
    wisely, did not give any reasons. Can it be that the
    Government, contemplating the extension of the "all-dry"
    principle to this country, are anxious to give no encouragement
    to the "drug-store habit"?</p>

    <h2>THE BEAUTIFUL WORDS.</h2>

    <p>I have to tell an unvarnished tale of real and recent life
    in London. When the absence of impulsive benevolence and public
    virtue is so often insisted upon it is my duty to put the
    following facts on record.</p>

    <p>It was, as it now always is, a wet day. The humidity not
    only descended from a pitiless sky, but ascended from the cruel
    pavements which cover the stony heart of that inexorable
    stepmother, London. Need I say that under these conditions no
    cabs were obtainable? In other words it was one of those days,
    so common of late, when other people engage the cabs first.
    They were plentiful enough, full. One could have been run over
    and killed by them twenty times between Trafalgar Square and
    Piccadilly Circus, but all teemed with selfish life. Men of
    ferocious concentration and women detestable in their
    purposefulness were to be seen through the passing windows. It
    was a day on which no one ever got out of a cab at all, except
    to tell it to wait. No flag was ever up. Since the blessing of
    peace began to be ours these days have been the rule.</p>

    <p>Not only were the cabs all taken and reserved till
    to-morrow, but the 'buses were overcrowded too. A line of
    swaying men, steaming from the deluge, intervened in every 'bus
    between two rows of seated women, also steaming. It was a day
    on which the conductors and conductresses were always ringing
    the bell three times.</p>

    <p>There was also (for we are very thorough in England) a
    strike on the Tube and the Underground.</p>

    <p>Having to get to Harley Street, I walked up Regent Street,
    doing my best to shelter beneath an umbrella, and (being a
    believer in miracles) turning my head back at every other step
    in the hope that a cab with its flag up might suddenly
    materialise; but hoping against hope. It was miserable, it was
    depressing, and it was really rather shameful: by the year 1919
    A.D. (I thought) more should have been achieved by boastful
    mankind in the direction of weather control.</p>

    <p>And then the strange thing happened which it is my purpose
    and pride to relate. A taxi drew up beside me and I was hailed
    by its occupant. In a novel the hailing voice would be that of
    a lady or a Caliph <i>incog.</i>, and it would lure me to
    adventure or romance. But this was desperately real damp
    beastly normal life, and the speaker was merely a man like
    myself.</p>

    <p>"Hullo!" he said, calling me by name, and following the
    salutation by the most grateful and comforting words that the
    human tongue could at that moment utter.</p>

    <p>Every one has seen the Confession Albums, where complacent
    or polite visitors are asked to state what in their opinion is
    the most beautiful this and that and the other, always
    including "the most beautiful form of words." Serious people
    quote from DANTE or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"
       id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span> KEATS or SHAKSPEARE;
       flippant persons write "Not guilty" or "Will you have it in
       notes or cash?" or "This way to the exit." Henceforth I
       shall be in no doubt as to my own reply. I shall set down
       the words used by this amazing god in the machine, this
       prince among all princely bolts from the blue. "Hullo," he
       said, "let me give you a lift."</p>

    <p>I could have sobbed with joy as I entered the
    cab&mdash;perhaps I did sob with joy&mdash;and heard him
    telling the driver the number in Harley Street for which I was
    bound.</p>

    <p>That is the story&mdash;true and rare. How could I refrain
    from telling it when impulsive benevolence and public virtue
    are so rare? It was my duty.</p>

    <h2>BOOK-BOOMING.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>With grateful acknowledgments to the leading Masters of
    this delectable art.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Messrs. Puffington and Co. beg to announce the immediate
    issue of <i>Charity Blueblood</i>, by Faith Redfern. Speaking
    <i>ex cathedra</i>, with a full consciousness of their
    responsibilities, they have no hesitation in pronouncing their
    assured conviction that this novel will take its place above
    all the classics of fiction.</p>

    <p>Here is not only a Thing of Beauty, but a Joy for Ever,
    wrought by elfin fingers, fashioned of gossamer threads at once
    fine and prehensile. Yet so Gargantuan and Goliardic that the
    reader holds his breath, lest the whole beatific caboodle
    should vanish into thin air and leave him lamenting like a
    Peri shut out from Paradise.</p>

    <p>But this is more than a Paradise. It is a Pandemonium, a
    Pantosocratic Pantechnicon and a Pantheon as well. For here,
    within the narrow compass of 750 pages (price 7<i>s.</i>
    11&frac34;<i>d.</i>), we find all the glory that was Greece and
    the grandeur that was Rome; the Olympian serenity of HOMER, the
    pity and terror of &AElig;SCHYLUS, the poignancy of CATULLUS,
    the saucy mirth of ARISTOPHANES, the sanity of SHAKSPEARE, the
    <i>macabre</i> gruesomeness of BAUDELAIRE, the sardonic
    <i>rictus</i> of HEINE and the geniality of TROLLOPE. All this
    and much more.</p>

    <p>Here, as we turn every page, we expect to meet
    <i>Rosalind</i> and <i>Jeanie Deans</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i> and
    <i>Aramis</i>, <i>Mr. Micawber</i> and <i>Madame Bovary</i>,
    <i>Eugenie Grandet</i> and <i>Colonel Newcome</i>,
    <i>Casanova</i> and <i>Casablanca</i>, <i>Consuelo</i> and
    "CAGLIOSTRO," and, if we do not meet them, we encounter new and

    water to wine.</p>

    <p>Here, with its bliss and agony, its cacophony and
    cachinnation, is Life, such as you and I know it, not life in
    absolute <i>d&eacute;shabill&eacute;</i>, but enveloped in the
    iridescent upholstery of genius, sublimated by the wizardry of
    a transcendental polyphony.</p>

    <p>Here, soaring high above the cenotaph in which the roses and
    rapture of our youth lie entombed in one red burial blent, we
    see the shimmering strands of St. Martin's Summer drawn athwart
    the happenless days of Autumn, with the dewdrops of cosmic
    unction sparkling in the rays of a sunshine never yet seen on
    land or sea, but reflecting as in a magic mirror that far off
    El Dorado, that land where Summer always is "i-cumen in," for
    which each and all of us feel a perpetual nostalgia.</p>

    <p>Here, in fine, gentle reader, is a work of such colossal
    force that to render justice to its abysmal greatness we have
    ransacked the vocabulary of superlative laudation in vain.
    SWINBURNE, compared to the needs of the situation, is as a
    shape of quivering jelly alongside of the Rock of Gibraltar.
    And here, O captious critic, is a Wonderwork which not only
    disarms but staggers, paralyses and annihilates all
    possibilities of animadversion, unless you wish to share the
    fate of Marsyas, by pitting your puny strength against the
    overwhelming panoply of divine and immortal genius.</p>

    <h2><i>LE FRAN&Ccedil;AIS TEL QUE L'ON LE PARLE.</i></h2>

    <p>It was on my journey to Paris that I ran across little Prior
    in the train. He too was going, he said, on Peace Conference
    work. His is a communicative disposition and before we had
    fairly started on our journey he had unfolded his plans. He
    said the Conference was bound to last a long time, and as a
    resident in a foreign country he had a splendid opportunity to
    learn the language. He meant, he said, to get to know it
    thoroughly later on. He then produced his French Pronouncing
    Handbook.</p>

    <p>I thought I knew French pretty well until I saw that book.
    It gave Prior expressions to use in the most casual
    conversation that I have never heard of in my life. It had a
    wonderful choice of words. Only an experienced philologist
    could have told you their exact origin.</p>

    <p>The handbook had foreseen every situation likely to arise
    abroad; and I think it overrated one's ordinary experiences. I
    have known people who have resided in France for years and
    never once had occasion to ask a billiard-marker if he would
    "<i>Envoyer-nous des crachoirs</i>." Most people can rub along
    on a holiday quite cheerfully without a spittoon; but then the
    handbook never meant you to be deprived of home comforts for
    the want of asking.</p>

    <p>Nor did it intend, with all its oily phraseology, that you
    should be imposed on. There is a scene in a "print-shop" over
    the authenticity of an engraving which gets to an exceedingly
    painful climax.</p>

    <p>A good deal of reliance is placed on the innate courtesy of
    the French. For it appears that, after an entire morning spent
    at the stationer's, when the shop-keeper has discussed every
    article he has for sale, you wind up by saying, "<i>Je prendrai
    une petite bouteille d'encre noire,</i>" and all that
    long-suffering man retorts is, "<i>J'voo zangvairay ler
    pah-kay,</i>" which is not nearly so bolshevistic as it
    looks.</p>

    <p>Prior said he was going to start to speak French directly he
    got on board the steamer&mdash;he had learnt that part off by
    heart already. The first remark he must make was, "Send the
    Captain to me at once." There is no indication of riot or
    uproar at this. Evidently the Captain is brought without the
    slightest difficulty, for in the very next line we find Prior
    saying, "<i>&Ecirc;tes-vous le Capitaine?</i>" and he goes on
    to inquire about his berth.</p>

    <p>The Captain tells him everything there is to know about
    berths and then apparently offers to take down his luggage, for
    Prior is commanding, "Take care of my carpet-bag, if you
    please."</p>

    <p>They then begin to discuss the weather. "In what quarter is
    the wind?" asks the indefatigable Prior.</p>

    <p>"The wind," says the Captain, "is in the north, in the
    south, in the east, in the south-west. It will be a rough
    passage. It will be very calm."</p>

    <p>Prior does not seem to observe that the Captain appears to
    be hedging. This wealth of information even pleases him, and
    then quite abruptly he demands, "<i>Donnez-moi une
    couverture,</i>" because, as he goes on to explain, he "feels
    very sick." This gives the "Capitaine" an opportunity to
    escape. He says, "I will send the munitionnaire."</p>

    <p>Undoubtedly that Captain has a sense of the ridiculous. I
    like the man. Anyone who could, on the spur of the moment,
    describe the steward as the munitionnaire deserves to rank as
    one of the world's humourists. But Prior is apparently in no
    condition to see a joke. He says he will have the munitionnaire
    instantly bringing in his hand "<i>un verre d'eau de
    vie.</i>"</p>

    <p>I was really sorry that in the bustle of embarking I lost
    sight of Prior and therefore could not witness the meeting
    between him and the Captain. It would have made me happy for
    the whole day.</p>

    <p>The crossing was prolonged, for we took a zig-zag course to
    avoid any little remembrances Fritz might have left us in the
    form of mines. When we were nearing land I saw Prior again. He
    was stretched out on a deck-chair and looked up with a ghastly
    smile as he caught sight of me.</p>

    <p>"Hullo, you're alone!" I said rather cruelly. "Is this the
    stage where the Captain goes to find the munitionnaire?"</p>

    <p>Then he spoke, but it was not in the words of the
    phrase-book. It was in clear, concise, unmistakable
    English.</p>

    <p>"Can you tell me," he asked, and behind his words lay a
    suggestion of quiet force of despair, "about what hour of the
    day or night this cursed boat is likely to get to Boolong?"</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerics.</i>)</h4>

    <p>In <i>Forty Days in 1914</i> (CONSTABLE), Major-General Sir
    F. MAURICE does more than revive our fading recollections of
    the retreat from Mons and the marvellous recovery on the Marne.
    A careful study of the German documents relating to VON KLUCK'S
    dash for Paris has led the author to form a new theory to
    account for the German defeat. Hitherto we have been asked to
    believe that VON KLUCK'S fatal change of direction, just when
    he seemed to have Paris at his mercy, was due to an urgent call
    for assistance from the CROWN PRINCE. General MAURICE holds, on
    the contrary, that it was deliberately adopted, at a moment
    when the CROWN PRINCE'S army was undefeated, in the belief that
    the French Fifth Army could be enveloped and destroyed, in
    which event "the whole French line would be rolled up and Paris
    entered after a victory such as history had never yet
    recorded." Thus, not for the first time, a too rigid adherence
    to MOLTKE'S theory of envelopment proved disastrous to the
    Germans' chances of success. It had first caused them to invade
    Belgium, and so brought Britain into the War at the very
    outset; it had next caused VON KLUCK to continue his westward
    sweep after Mons at a juncture when a vigorous pursuit by his
    cavalry might have turned the British retreat into a rout; and
    finally it caused him to execute the notoriously dangerous
    manoeuvre of changing front before an unbeaten foe, and to give
    JOFFRE the opportunity for which he had been patiently waiting.
    The fact was that VON KLUCK did not think the British were
    unbeaten. He could not conceive that men who had just endured
    such a harassing experience as the seven days' continuous
    retreat could possibly be in a condition to turn and fight. Not
    for the first or last time in the War German psychology was
    woefully at fault. Whether General MAURICE'S theory is correct
    or not, it is most attractively set forth, and, thanks to the
    excellent; maps with which the volume is provided, can be
    easily followed even by the non-military reader.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There was at first a little danger of my being put off
    <i>Fruit of Earth</i> (METHUEN) by the uneasy manner of its
    opening chapters and a style that it is permissible to call
    distinctly "fruity." Thus on page 5 J. MILLS WHITHAM is found
    writing about "an astonishment that nearly smudged the last
    spark of vitality from a hunger-bitten author," and a good deal
    more in the same style. But I am glad to say that the tale
    subsequently pulls itself together, and, despite some
    occasional high-falutin, becomes an interesting and human
    affair. It is a story of country life, the main theme of which
    is a twofold jealousy, that of the chronic invalid, <i>Mrs.
    Linsell</i>, towards the girl <i>Mary</i>, whom she rightly
    suspects of displacing her in the thoughts of <i>Inglebury</i>;
    and that of <i>Amos</i>, who marries <i>Mary</i>, towards
    <i>Inglebury</i>, whom <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"
       id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span> he rightly suspects of
       occupying too much room in the reflections of his wife. In
       other words, the simple life at its most suspicious, with
       the rude forefathers of the hamlet supplying a scandalous
       chorus. The strongest part of the story is the tragedy,
       suggested with a poignancy almost too vivid, of the wretched
       elder woman, tortured in mind and body, morbidly aware of
       the contrast between her own decay and the vitality of her
       rival. As to <i>Inglebury</i> and <i>Mary</i>, the causes of
       all the pother, they struck me as conspicuously unworth so
       much fussing over; and, when their final flight together
       landed them&mdash;well, where it did, I could only feel that
       the neighbourhood was to be congratulated. But, as you see,
       I had by this time become unwillingly interested. So there
       you have it; an unequal book, about people unattractive but
       alive.</p>

    <p>When the literary Roll of Honour of all the belligerents
    comes to be considered quietly, in the steady light of Peace,
    not many names will stand higher in any country than that of
    our English writer, HECTOR HUGH MUNRO, whose subtle and witty
    satires, stories and fantasies were put forth under the
    pseudonym "SAKI." I have but to name <i>The Chronicles of
    Clovis</i> for discriminating readers to know what their loss
    was when MUNRO (who, although over age, had enlisted as a
    private and refused a commission) fell fighting in the
    Beaumont-Hamel action in November 1916. Mr. JOHN LANE has
    brought out, under the title <i>The Toys of Peace</i>, a last
    collection of "SAKI'S" fugitive works, with a sympathetic but
    all too brief memoir by Mr. ROTHAY REYNOLDS. Although "SAKI" is
    only occasionally at his very best in this volume&mdash;on the
    grim side, in "The Interlopers," and in his more familiar
    irresponsible and high-spirited way in "A Bread-and-Butter
    Miss" and "The Seven Cream Jugs;" although there may be no
    masterpiece of fun or raillery to put beside, say,
    "Esm&eacute;;" there is in every story a phrase or fancy marked
    by his own inimitable felicity, audacity or humour. It is good
    news that a complete uniform edition of his books is in
    preparation.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I can't help feeling that ISABEL ECCLESTONE MACKAY'S chief
    aim in <i>Up the Hill and Over</i> (HURST AND BLAOKETT) was to
    write a convincing tract for the times on a subject which is
    achieving unhappy prominence in America as in our own
    police-courts. A worthy aim, I doubt not. One of the chief
    characters is a drug-taker; and as if that were not enough
    another is "out of her head," while a third, <i>Dr.
    Callandar</i>, the Montreal specialist, is in the throes of a
    nervous breakdown. This seems to me to be distinctly overdoing
    it. It is the doctor's love-story (a story so complicated that
    I cannot attempt a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i>) which is the
    designedly central but actually subordinate theme. I have the
    absurd idea that this might really have begun life as a
    pathological thesis and suffered conversion into a novel. The
    author has no conscience in the matter of the employment of the
    much-abused device of coincidence. And I don't think the story
    would cure anyone of drug-taking. On the contrary.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Three Black Pennys</i> (HEINEMANN) is a story that
    began by perplexing and ended by making a complete conquest of
    me. Its author, Mr. JOSEPH HERGESHEIMER, is, I think, new to
    this side of the Atlantic; the publishers tell me (and, to
    prevent any natural misapprehension, I pass on the information
    at once) that he belongs to "a Pennsylvania Dutch family,
    settled for many generations in Philadelphia." Which being so,
    one can enjoy his work with a free conscience. It certainly
    seems to me very unusual in quality. The theme of the tale is
    the history of the <i>Penny</i> family, or rather of the
    periodical outcrop in it of a certain strain that produces
    <i>Pennys</i> dark of countenance and incalculable of conduct.
    This recurrence is shown in three examples: the first,
    <i>Howart Penny</i>, in the days when men wore powder and the
    <i>Penny</i> forge had just been started in what was then a
    British colony; the next, <i>Jasper</i>, involved in a murder
    trial in the sixties; and; last of the black <i>Pennys</i>,
    another <i>Howart</i>, in whom the family energy has thinned to
    a dilettante appreciation of the arts, dying alone amongst his
    collections. You can see from this outline that the book is
    incidentally liable to confound the skipper, who may find
    himself confronted with (apparently) the same character tying a
    periwig on one page and hiring a taxi on another. I am mistaken
    though if you will feel inclined to skip a single page of a
    novel at once so original and well-told. As a detail of
    criticism I had the feeling that the "blackness" of the
    <i>Penny</i> exceptions would have shown up better had we seen
    more of the family in its ordinary rule; but of the power
    behind Mr. HERGESHEIMER'S work there can be no question. He is,
    I am sure, an artist upon a quite unusual scale, from whom
    great things may be anticipated.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>If neither book of short stories before me is what Americans
    call "the goods," I can, at any rate, say that <i>Ancient
    Mariners</i> (MILLS AND BOON) does infinite credit to Mr.
    MORLEY ROBERTS'S imagination. These yarns of seafaring men are
    salt with the savour of the sea and with the language thereof.
    Of the seven my favourite is "Potter's Plan," which not only
    contains the qualities to be found in the other half-dozen, but
    also has an ingenuity all its own. But perhaps you will prefer
    "A Bay Dog-Watch," as coming home to the general bosom, for it
    deals with a ferocious hunt after matches which recalls the
    deadly days of the shortage. Of the five stories in Mr. WARWICK
    DEEPING'S <i>Countess Glika</i> (CASSELL) the best is "Bitter
    Silence." Here the author deals with essentials, and gives us a
    tale entirely free from artificiality. The remaining stories
    are marred by their lack of naturalness; but Mr. DEEPING is
    never at a loss for incident, and he can write dialogue which
    is often gay and sometimes witty.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
